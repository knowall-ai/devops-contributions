|Problem |Solution

|**SVG file types not supported** when uploading to Marketplace
|Convert SVG to PNG: `convert -density 300 logo.svg -resize 128x128 logo.png` then delete the SVG file.

|**node-sass build failure** with gyp errors
|Replace `node-sass` with Dart Sass: use `"gulp-sass": "^5.1.0"` and `"sass": "^1.71.0"` in package.json, update gulpfile to `require('gulp-sass')(require('sass'))`.

|**@types/jqueryui TypeScript errors** (TS1110)
|Pin compatible version: `"@types/jqueryui": "1.12.7"` in package.json.

|**Widget not appearing** in dashboard catalog
|Verify extension is shared with your organization and installed from Organization Settings → Extensions → Shared tab.

|**Configuration not saving**
|Ensure `configurationContributionId` matches pattern: `{publisher}.{extension-id}.{config-id}`.

|**tfx: command not found** during build
|Install tfx-cli: `npm install -g tfx-cli`.

|**Contributions not loading**
|Check that the extension has `vso.work` and `vso.code` scopes, and user has permissions to view work items and code.
